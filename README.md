# Image-processing-in-opencv-python
my first project for image processing in opencv python is the Skin detection using my laptop's webcam , this project is all about skin detection using pyhton and opencv. To detect the skin we are using hsv color space. Set the upper and lower limit in pixel intensity in hsv color space to detect skin in the video. For faster skin detection process we are using the imutils function to reisize the frame. The frames from the webcam are in bgr color space so we need to convert it into hsv color space. Now by using cv2.inRange we create mask function. After that we are using erode ,dilation and guassianblur fuction to improve the detection process. After that finally we display the output.
